# Your private image registry on Kubernetes

## Objective
Create your own image registry for your k8s cluster using a stand alone docker server

## Assumptions

* You already have a K8s cluster v1.5 up and running (my case it's with nuage as overlay network)
* A stand alone docker server on the same network
* All servers has access to internet and restrictions to connect each other

# Install you playbook
...coming soon
